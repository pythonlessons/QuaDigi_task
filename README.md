# QuaDigi_task Exercise 

## Part 1
You were given a map (2 dimensional grid) where each cell is either forest (marked as X) or grassland (marked as O).  
Write a script that gets number of isolated forests on the map. Forest is formed of cells X that are connected in one of 8 directions. In case code is not working, please explain the search strategy. 
(Example on next page) 

## Example: 
There are two forests in the map (red and green) bellow: 
0X0X0 
00XX0 
00000 
0XX00 

## Part 2
Add some tests (2-3) for the task above.
It would be preferable to use unittest library to create assertions for methods.
It would be nice if the tests are written in a separate file but not necessary.
